TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

Problem: Low system pressure
Possible Causes:
- Worn pump internals
- Clogged inlet filter
- Air in hydraulic system
- Faulty pressure relief valve
- Low hydraulic fluid level

Solutions:
1. Check hydraulic fluid level and add if necessary
2. Replace inlet filter if clogged
3. Bleed air from system using proper procedures
4. Test and adjust pressure relief valve
5. Inspect pump for internal wear

Problem: Excessive noise and vibration
Possible Causes:
- Air in hydraulic system
- Worn pump bearings
- Misaligned coupling
- Cavitation due to restricted inlet
- Loose mounting bolts

Solutions:
1. Bleed air from hydraulic system
2. Replace worn pump bearings
3. Realign pump coupling
4. Check inlet line for restrictions
5. Tighten all mounting bolts

Problem: Hydraulic fluid overheating
Possible Causes:
- Insufficient cooling
- Overloaded system
- Contaminated fluid
- Worn pump components
- Restricted return line

Solutions:
1. Clean cooling fins and check fan operation
2. Reduce system load if possible
3. Change hydraulic fluid and clean system
4. Inspect pump for internal wear
5. Check return line for restrictions

Problem: External fluid leaks
Possible Causes:
- Worn shaft seals
- Loose fittings
- Damaged O-rings
- Cracked housing
- Worn gaskets

Solutions:
1. Replace shaft seals
2. Tighten all fittings to proper torque
3. Replace damaged O-rings
4. Inspect housing for cracks
5. Replace worn gaskets
